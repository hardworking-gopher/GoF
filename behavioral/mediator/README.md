# Mediator

Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects.
The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator 
object.

# What does it solve?

Pilots of aircraft that approach or depart the airport control area donâ€™t communicate directly with each other.
Instead, they speak to an air traffic controller, who sits in a tall tower somewhere near the airstrip.
Without the air traffic controller, pilots would need to be aware of every plane in the vicinity of the airport,
discussing landing priorities with a committee of dozens of other pilots. That would probably skyrocket the airplane
crash statistics.
