# Prototype

Prototype is a creational pattern that lets you create new objects by copying an existing object, known as the "prototype."
Instead of creating objects from scratch using a class constructor, you start with a template object and clone it
This pattern is useful when the cost of creating a new object is more expensive than cloning an existing one, or when you 
need to create objects whose exact type is specified at runtime.
