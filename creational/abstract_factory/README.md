# Abstract Factory

This pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Think of it as a "factory of factories." It's particularly useful when you need to ensure that the products created by a factory are all of a compatible variant. This implementation demonstrates how the Abstract Factory pattern allows the client to create products that belong to a specific family (brand) without needing to know the concrete types of those products. This leads to more flexible and decoupled code.
